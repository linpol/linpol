This mbpol was released on 22-Nov-2013

1. Go to the mbpol subdirectory and build libmbpol.a [adjust the Makefile
   as needed]; this is going to take some time and memory and produce
   libmbpol.a

2. Fortran/C++ linkage examples are in the corresponding sub-folders
   (you may need to adjust the compiler flags).
